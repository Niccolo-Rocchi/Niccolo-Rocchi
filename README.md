### Hi everyone! :honeybee::smiley:

I'm NiccolÃ². I have a Bachelor Degree in in Mathematics and I am having soon a Master Degree in Data Science :dizzy:

I love diving into Maths and Computer Science universes: fascinating as well as very dangerous! :astonished:

"Every day that passes by, makes my love for you grow even stronger": this would be my mantra with Tux and Free Software :penguin: 

Here's some of my GitHub information:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Causal Discovery library and Data Science projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the awesome Rust
- :zap: I commonly use to program in Python or R

Remember me with these words: Travelling, Discovering and Beekeeping :green_heart:
